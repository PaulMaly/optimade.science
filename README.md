OPTIMADE dot Science
==========

This is a very simple minimalistic in-browser OPTIMADE client, written in a vanilla ES5 JavaScript.
It fetches the providers list from the OPTIMADE website, looks for the structure endpoints, and allows sequential querying against all of them, aggregating the results together.
All relatively modern web-browsers including IE11 are supported.
