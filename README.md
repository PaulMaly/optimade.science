OPTIMADE dot Science
==========

This is a very simple minimalistic in-browser OPTIMADE client, written in a vanilla ES5 JavaScript.
It fetches the OPTIMADE providers list, looks for the structure endpoints, and allows sequential querying against all of them, aggregating the results together.
Technically this is just the single file `index.html`.
All relatively modern web-browsers including IE11 are supported.
